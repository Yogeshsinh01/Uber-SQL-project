# Uber Ride-Hailing Analysis Project  

## Overview  
This project analyzes a simulated dataset inspired by Uber's operations. The dataset includes information about rides, drivers, and passengers, offering insights into the ride-hailing business. Using SQL for data analysis, the project provides data-driven recommendations to enhance service efficiency and customer satisfaction.  

## Objective  
The goal of this project is to utilize SQL to:  
- Identify patterns in ride requests and driver performance.  
- Uncover trends to optimize operational efficiency.  
- Improve customer experience and satisfaction through insights.  
- Provide actionable recommendations for better service delivery.  

By exploring the relationships between rides, drivers, and passengers, the analysis simulates real-world dynamics, demonstrating how data can inform decision-making, fleet management, and service improvements.  

## Key Insights and Solutions  

1. **Streamlined Operations**  
   - Analyze ride frequency, peak times, and geographic hotspots to optimize ride distribution.  

2. **Enhanced Driver Performance**  
   - Assess ratings, trip completion rates, and earnings to identify areas for driver improvement.  

3. **Improved Customer Experience**  
   - Explore passenger preferences, wait times, and ride durations to enhance service efficiency.  

This project highlights how SQL can transform raw data into actionable insights, showcasing its value in improving operational efficiency and customer satisfaction for ride-hailing services.  

## Project Structure  

### 1. Data Exploration & Preprocessing  
- Load and inspect the dataset.  
- Clean data by handling missing values and removing irrelevant columns.  
- Establish relationships between rides, drivers, and passengers using SQL joins and aggregations.  

### 2. Data Analysis  
- Explore ride frequency, peak times, and geographic hotspots using SQL queries.  
- Evaluate driver performance metrics, such as ratings, trip completion rates, and earnings.  
- Analyze passenger trends, including wait times, ride durations, and preferences.  

### 3. Data-Driven Recommendations  
- Recommend strategies for optimizing ride distribution based on demand patterns.  
- Suggest improvements for driver performance and passenger experience based on insights.  

## Tools Used  
- **SQL**: For querying and analyzing data.  
- **Simulated Dataset**: Mimicking real-world ride-hailing scenarios.
